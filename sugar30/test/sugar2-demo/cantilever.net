% This netlist describes a cantilever beam with a force applied
% at the end.  The netlist lines describe
%
%  - An anchor fabricated in the first polySi layer (p1).
%    Note that this netlist assumes the default process
%    (which is MUMPS).  Parameters describing the different
%    layers in this process (e.g. Young's modulus and film
%    thickness) are specified in the file processmaster.m.
%    The node 'substrate' is where the anchor is attached.
%  - A beam, also made from the first polySi layer, which
%    runs from the node 'substrate' to node 'tip'.  The
%    beam is 100 microns long, and has a 2 micron-by-2 micron
%    cross section.
%  - A 2 micro-Newton force applied at a right angle to the 
%    tip of the beam
