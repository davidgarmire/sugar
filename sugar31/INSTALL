If you have downloaded a *pre-compiled* package, you need to do almost
nothing.  To set up your Matlab paths correctly, type

  >> run c:/sugar30/sugar_init.m

at the Matlab path; if you see a banner displaying the version information,
everything is set.  Otherwise, you should get a diagnostic message that
tells you that you need to compile for your platform.


For Unix users:

 - Make sure the system MEX script is in your path (this script comes
   with Matlab)
 - Cross your fingers 
 - Type ./configure
 - Type make

SUGAR can take advantage of several different packages you might have
installed.  To learn more about the configuration options, type

  ./configure --help

in the SUGAR root directory.


For Windows users:

 - Before you start, be forewarned -- compiling under Windows is more
   complicated than it is under Unix.  If you're uncertain about what
   you're doing, please check to see if there is a pre-compiled version
   that meets your needs.  The version on the web page should work
   for Matlab 6.x.  While SUGAR should work with Matlab 5 in principle,
   it is no longer tested against Matlab 5.

 - SUGAR can be compiled with the Cygwin system and gnumex.  The files
   and setup instructions for gnumex are available at:

     http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/gnumex20.html

   I use the Cygwin shell and the mingw compiler to build the system.

 - Once you have set up the gnumex system, make sure that the mex.bat file
   is in your path and follow the Unix directions (./configure; make)
