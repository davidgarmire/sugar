% This demonstration netlist describes an oddly-shaped
% structure consisting of 
%
%  - An anchor at node 'substrate' in the first polySi layer
%  - A 100 micron beam from 'substrate' to 'A' in the same layer
%  - Two 50 micron beams extending from 'A' at 45 degree angles to
%    the default orientation, where the rotation is about the z axis.
%    In the default orientation, the direction from the first to second
%    node is the positive x direction.
%  - An arm sticking up at an angle out of the x-y plane, extending
%    from the end of one of the arms of the Y-shaped structure.
%  - A one nano-Newton-meter moment applied at D
